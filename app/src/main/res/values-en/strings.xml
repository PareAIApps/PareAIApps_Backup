    <!--   About   -->
    <string name="background">
       The agricultural sector plays a vital role in maintaining food security and driving national economic growth.
    In the third quarter of 2023, this sector contributed 13.57% to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP).
    However, farmers still face serious challenges, particularly in terms of accurate and timely plant disease detection.
    Traditional methods that are still in use often lead to misdiagnosis, excessive pesticide use, and risk of crop failure,
    as witnessed in Lamongan due to neck blast disease attacks on rice plants.\n\nWith the development of artificial intelligence (AI) technology, especially Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN),
    plant disease detection can be performed automatically with high accuracy through leaf image processing.
    Furthermore, with the utilization of Large Language Models (LLMs) based on Natural Language Processing (NLP),
    farmers can be assisted by interactive ChatBots that provide real-time advice and information on plant disease management.
    This combination of technologies not only improves agricultural efficiency but also supports more sustainable farming practices.
    </string>

        <string name="objective">
        1. Develop PareAI, a Machine Learning and Large Language Models-based application to automatically detect rice plant diseases.\n2. Provide an interactive NLP-based ChatBot feature that delivers information and disease management recommendations to farmers.\n3. Improve the accuracy of plant disease diagnosis and reduce dependence on pesticides through modern technological approaches.\n4. Support farmer welfare and national agricultural productivity through easily accessible technological solutions.
    </string>

        <string name="about_us_text">
        We are a team of students from the Informatics Engineering Program at Jakarta State Polytechnic,
    who are passionate about making real contributions to Indonesias agricultural sector through technological innovation.
    With backgrounds in programming, artificial intelligence, and application development,
    we have developed PareAI, a smart application that utilizes Machine Learning and ChatBot
    to help farmers detect plant diseases quickly, accurately, and sustainably.
    </string>

        <string name="application_features">
       1. Automatic Disease Detection: Farmers can upload images of rice leaves for automatic detection by a Machine Learning (CNN) based system.\n2. Treatment Recommendations: The application provides information on disease symptoms, severity levels, and appropriate treatment suggestions.\n3. Interactive ChatBot: A Large Language Models (LLMs) based ChatBot provides real-time answers to farmers questions.\n4. Detection History: Stores disease detection data and ChatBot interactions so farmers can view their usage history.\n5. Offline Support: Several application features remain usable even in unstable network conditions through Firebase.\n6. Simple Interface: The application interface is designed to be easily understood and operated by farmers.
